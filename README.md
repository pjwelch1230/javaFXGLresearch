Followed multiple tutorials created by YouTube creator Almas Baimagambetov
 (including the tutorial for the JavaFX version of this game: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjuytZhQYo8&ab_channel=AlmasBaimagambetov)
I used the base of the game tutorial provided to strengthen my java foundation and learn the FXGL library. From there I learned how to implement background images,
timers, menus, and sound effects.
